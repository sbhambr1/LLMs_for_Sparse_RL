Here is a pddl domain, a planning problem. Provide the plan for the query problem. Provide only the pddl syntax for the plan where each action is represented as (ACTION_NAME OBJECTS).

[DOMAIN]
(define (domain household)
    (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions)
    (:types key door - object)
    (:predicates (key0-picked)
                 (key1-picked)
                 (holding-key)
                 (door0-opened)
                 (door1-opened)
                 (at-starting-location)
                 (charged)
                 (at-destination))
    (:action get_key0
            :parameters ()
            :precondition (and (not(holding-key)))
            :effect (and (key0-picked) (holding-key)))
    (:action get_key1
            :parameters ()
            :precondition (and (not(holding-key)))
            :effect (and (key1-picked) (holding-key)))
    (:action open_door0
            :parameters ()
            :precondition (and (not (door0-opened)) (holding-key) (key0-picked))
            :effect (and (door0-opened) (not(holding-key)) (not (key0-picked))))
    (:action open_door1
            :parameters ()
            :precondition (and (not (door1-opened)) (holding-key) (key1-picked) (door0-opened))
            :effect (and (door1-opened) (not(holding-key)) (not (key1-picked))))
    (:action is_charged
            :parameters ()
            :precondition (and (door0-opened)(door1-opened))
            :effect (and (charged)))
    (:action goal
            :parameters ()
            :precondition (and (charged) )
            :effect (and (at-destination)))
)

[PROBLEM]
(define (problem prob)
    (:domain household)
    (:objects
        key0 key1 - key
        door0 door1 - door)
    (:init
        (at-starting-location))
    (:goal
        (and (at-destination))
))

[YOUR RESPONSE]

LLM Response: here is the plan for the given problem in pddl syntax:

(get_key0)
(open_door0)
(is_charged)
(open_door1)
(get_key1)
(goal)

this plan achieves the goal by first picking up key0, then opening door0, then charging, then opening door1, then picking up key1, and finally reaching the destination.
-----------------
LLM Plan: ['here is the plan for the given problem in pddl syntax:', '(get_key0)', '(open_door0)', '(is_charged)', '(open_door1)', '(get_key1)', '(goal)', 'this plan achieves the goal by first picking up key0, then opening door0, then charging, then opening door1, then picking up key1, and finally reaching the destination.']
