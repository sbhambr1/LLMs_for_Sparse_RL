here is the plan for the query problem in pddl syntax:
(go_down_the_tube)
(pickup_key)
(pickup_hidden_key)
(go_up_the_ladder)
(unlock_door)
this plan achieves the goal of opening the door by first going down the tube, then picking up the key and hidden key, then going up the ladder with both keys, and finally unlocking the door.
