Here is a pddl domain, a planning problem. Provide the plan for the query problem. Provide only the pddl syntax for the plan where each action is represented as (ACTION_NAME OBJECTS).

[DOMAIN]

[PROBLEM]

    (:objects
        key0 key1 - key

[YOUR RESPONSE]

LLM Response: here is the plan in pddl syntax:

(get_key0)
(get_key1)
(open_door0)
(open_door1)
(is_charged)
(goal)

this plan consists of the following actions:

1. `get_key0`: pick up key0
2. `get_key1`: pick up key1
3. `open_door0`: open door0 with key0
4. `open_door1`: open door1 with key1 and door0 already open
5. `is_charged`: check if both doors are open and charged
6. `goal`: reach the destination

note that this plan assumes that the `get_key0` and `get_key1` actions are executed before `open_door0` and `open_door1`, respectively. this is because the preconditions of `open_door0` and `open_door1` require the corresponding keys to be picked up first.
