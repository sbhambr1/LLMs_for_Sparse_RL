here is the plan for the query problem:
(get_wood wood0)
(get_processed_wood wood0)
(make_plank wood0)
(make_stick)
(make_ladder)
this plan satisfies the goal of making a ladder by first picking up wood0, then processing it, then making a plank from it, then making a stick, and finally making a ladder using the stick and plank.
