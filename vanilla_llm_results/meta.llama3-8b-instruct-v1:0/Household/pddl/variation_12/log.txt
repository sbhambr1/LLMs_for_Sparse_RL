Here is a pddl domain, a planning problem. Provide the plan for the query problem. Provide only the pddl syntax for the plan where each action is represented as (ACTION_NAME OBJECTS).

[DOMAIN]
(define (domain household)
    (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions)
    (:types key door - object)
    (:predicates (key0-picked)
                 (key1-picked)
                 (holding-key)

            :parameters ()

            :effect (and (door0-opened) (not(holding-key)) (not (key0-picked))))
    (:action open_door1

            :effect (and (door1-opened) (not(holding-key)) (not (key1-picked))))
    (:action is_charged
            :parameters ()
            :precondition (and (door0-opened)(door1-opened))
            :effect (and (charged)))
    (:action goal
            :parameters ()

[PROBLEM]
(define (problem prob)
    (:domain household)
    (:objects
        key0 key1 - key
        door0 door1 - door)
    (:init
        (at-starting-location))
    (:goal
        (and (at-destination))
))

[YOUR RESPONSE]

LLM Response: here is the plan for the query problem:

(get_key0)
(open_door0)
(is_charged)
(open_door1)
(get_key1)
(is_charged)
(goal)

this plan achieves the goal of reaching the destination by picking up the keys, opening the doors, and charging the device. the plan starts by picking up the first key, then opening the first door, which allows the agent to pick up the second key. the agent then opens the second door, which allows it to charge the device and reach the destination.
-----------------
LLM Plan: ['here is the plan for the query problem:', '(get_key0)', '(open_door0)', '(is_charged)', '(open_door1)', '(get_key1)', '(is_charged)', '(goal)', 'this plan achieves the goal of reaching the destination by picking up the keys, opening the doors, and charging the device. the plan starts by picking up the first key, then opening the first door, which allows the agent to pick up the second key. the agent then opens the second door, which allows it to charge the device and reach the destination.']
