here is the plan in pddl syntax:
```
(get_key0)
(open_door0)
(get_key1)
(open_door1)
(is_charged)
(goal)
```
this plan achieves the goal of reaching the destination by:
1. picking up key0
2. opening door0 with key0
3. picking up key1
4. opening door1 with key1 and the previously opened door0
5. charging the device (since both doors are open)
6. reaching the destination (since the device is charged)
note that this plan assumes that the preconditions and effects of the actions are satisfied, and that the problem is solvable.
