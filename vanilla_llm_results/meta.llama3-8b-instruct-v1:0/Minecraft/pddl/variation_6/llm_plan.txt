here is the plan for the query problem in pddl syntax:
(get_wood wood0)
(get_processed_wood wood0)
(make_plank wood0)
(make_stick wood1)
(make_ladder)
this plan achieves the goal of making a ladder by first picking up wood0, then processing it, then making a plank from wood0, then making a stick from wood1, and finally making a ladder using the stick and plank.
