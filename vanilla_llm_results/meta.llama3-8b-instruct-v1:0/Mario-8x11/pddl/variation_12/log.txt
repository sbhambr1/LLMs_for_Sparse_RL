Here is a pddl domain, a planning problem. Provide the plan for the query problem. Provide only the pddl syntax for the plan where each action is represented as (ACTION_NAME OBJECTS).

[DOMAIN]
(define (domain Mario)
    (:requirements :strips :typing)

            :effect (and (door-open)))
)

[PROBLEM]
(define (problem prob)
    (:domain Mario)
    (:objects
    )
    (:init
        (at-upper-platform))
    (:goal

[YOUR RESPONSE]

LLM Response: here is the plan for the query problem:

(go_down_the_tube)
(pickup_key)
(pickup_hidden_key)
(go_up_the_ladder)
(unlock_door)

this plan satisfies the goal of opening the door. the actions are executed in the following order:

1. go_down_the_tube: move from the upper platform to the bottom.
2. pickup_key: pick up the key.
3. pickup_hidden_key: pick up the hidden key.
4. go_up_the_ladder: move back to the upper platform with both the key and the hidden key.
5. unlock_door: unlock the door.

note that this plan assumes that the preconditions of each action are satisfied. in this case, the preconditions are met because the problem statement initializes the agent at the upper platform, and the actions are executed in a way that satisfies the preconditions of each subsequent action.
