You are tasked with solving a 6x9 maze where you will encounter objects like a key, a hidden key, a ladder, a tude, and a door along with walls. Your task is 'first collect both the keys one of which is hidden in a red rock and then use them to open the door located at upstairs'. You can only go down through the tube and must use a worn-out ladder to go back up. The ladder will break after one use, and the door can only be opened after both keys are collected. You will be given a description of the maze at the first step and you need to choose the set of actions to take. The available actions are 'left', 'right', 'up', 'down'.
