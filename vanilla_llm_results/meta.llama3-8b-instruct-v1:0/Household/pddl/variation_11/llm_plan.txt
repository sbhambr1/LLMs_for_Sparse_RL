this plan achieves the goal of reaching the destination by:
1. picking up key0 and key1
2. opening door0 and door1
3. charging the device
4. reaching the destination
note that the plan assumes that the preconditions of each action are satisfied, and that the effects of each action are applied in the order specified.
