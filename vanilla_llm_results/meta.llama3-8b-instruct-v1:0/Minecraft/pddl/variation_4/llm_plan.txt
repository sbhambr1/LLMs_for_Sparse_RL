here is the plan for the query problem in pddl syntax:
(:plan
(get_wood wood0)
(get_processed_wood wood0)
(make_plank wood0)
(make_stick)
(make_ladder)
)
this plan consists of five actions:
1. `get_wood wood0`: get the wood0 object.
2. `get_processed_wood wood0`: process the wood0 object.
3. `make_plank wood0`: make a plank from the processed wood0 object.
4. `make_stick`: make a stick from the processed wood0 object (since the wood0 object has already been processed).
5. `make_ladder`: make a ladder using the plank and stick made in the previous steps.
this plan satisfies the goal of making a ladder.
