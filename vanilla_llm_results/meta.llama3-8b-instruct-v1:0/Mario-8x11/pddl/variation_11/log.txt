Here is a pddl domain, a planning problem. Provide the plan for the query problem. Provide only the pddl syntax for the plan where each action is represented as (ACTION_NAME OBJECTS).

[DOMAIN]
(define (domain Mario)
    (:requirements :strips :typing)
    (:types key - object)
    (:predicates (has-key)
                (has-hidden-key)

            :parameters ()

            :effect (and (at-bottom) ))
    (:action pickup_key

    (:action unlock_door
            :parameters ()
            :precondition (and (at-upper-platform-with-key) (at-upper-platform-with-hidden-key) )
            :effect (and (door-open)))
)

[PROBLEM]
(define (problem prob)
    (:domain Mario)
    (:objects
    )
    (:init
        (at-upper-platform))
    (:goal
        (and (door-open))

[YOUR RESPONSE]

LLM Response: here is the plan in pddl syntax:

(go_down_the_tube)
(pickup_key)
(pickup_hidden_key)
(go_up_the_ladder)
(unlock_door)

this plan satisfies the goal of opening the door. the plan consists of the following steps:

1. go down the tube: this action allows mario to move from the upper platform to the bottom.
2. pickup key: this action allows mario to pick up the key at the bottom.
3. pickup hidden key: this action allows mario to pick up the hidden key at the bottom.
4. go up the ladder: this action allows mario to move back to the upper platform with both the key and the hidden key.
5. unlock door: this action allows mario to unlock the door at the upper platform with both the key and the hidden key.

note that this plan assumes that the initial state is that mario is at the upper platform, and the goal is to open the door.
