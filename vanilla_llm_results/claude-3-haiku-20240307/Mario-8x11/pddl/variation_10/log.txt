Here is a pddl domain, a planning problem. Provide the plan for the query problem. Provide only the pddl syntax for the plan where each action is represented as (ACTION_NAME OBJECTS).

[DOMAIN]
(define (domain Mario)
    (:requirements :strips :typing)
    (:types key - object)
    (:predicates (has-key)
                (has-hidden-key)
                (at-upper-platform)
                (at-bottom)
                (at-upper-platform-with-key)
                (at-upper-platform-with-hidden-key)
                (door-open))
    (:action go_down_the_tube
            :parameters ()
            :precondition (and (at-upper-platform))
            :effect (and (at-bottom) ))
    (:action pickup_key
            :parameters ()

    (:action pickup_hidden_key
            :parameters ()
            :precondition (and (at-bottom))
            :effect (and (has-hidden-key) ))
    (:action go_up_the_ladder
            :parameters ()
            :precondition (and (has-key) (has-hidden-key) (at-bottom))
            :effect (and (at-upper-platform-with-key) (at-upper-platform-with-hidden-key) ))
    (:action unlock_door
            :parameters ()
            :precondition (and (at-upper-platform-with-key) (at-upper-platform-with-hidden-key) )
            :effect (and (door-open)))
)

[PROBLEM]
(define (problem prob)
    (:domain Mario)
    (:objects
    )
    (:init
        (at-upper-platform))
    (:goal
        (and (door-open))
))
