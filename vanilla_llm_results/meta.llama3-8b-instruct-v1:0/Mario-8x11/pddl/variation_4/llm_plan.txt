(pickup_hidden_key)
(go_up_the_ladder)
(unlock_door)
this plan satisfies the goal of opening the door. here's a breakdown of each action:
1. (go_down_the_tube) - move from the upper platform to the bottom.
2. (pickup_key) - pick up the key.
3. (pickup_hidden_key) - pick up the hidden key.
4. (go_up_the_ladder) - move back to the upper platform with both the key and the hidden key.
5. (unlock_door) - unlock the door using the key and hidden key.
