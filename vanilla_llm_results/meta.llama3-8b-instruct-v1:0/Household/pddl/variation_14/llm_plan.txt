here is the plan for the query problem in pddl syntax:
(get_key0)
(open_door0)
(get_key1)
(open_door1)
(is_charged)
(goal)
this plan achieves the goal of reaching the destination by following these steps:
1. get key0
2. open door0
3. get key1
4. open door1
5. charge the device (is_charged)
6. reach the destination (goal)
note that the plan assumes that the preconditions for each action are satisfied at the time of execution.
