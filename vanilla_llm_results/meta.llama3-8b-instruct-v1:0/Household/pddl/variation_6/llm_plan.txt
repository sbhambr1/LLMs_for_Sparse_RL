here is the plan for the query problem in pddl syntax:
(get_key0)
(get_key1)
(open_door0)
(is_charged)
(open_door1)
(goal)
this plan satisfies the goal of reaching the destination while ensuring that the preconditions of each action are met. here's a brief explanation of the plan:
1. (get_key0) and (get_key1): we first pick up both keys to ensure we have them available for use.
2. (open_door0): we open door0 to gain access to the area where we can use the keys.
3. (is_charged): we ensure that both doors are open, which allows us to charge the device.
4. (open_door1): we open door1 to access the destination.
5. (goal): we reach the destination, which satisfies the goal.
note that this plan assumes that the preconditions of each action are met, and that the actions are executed in the order specified.
